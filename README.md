# Financial-Planner-Modeler-Budgeting - The FinancialFitness App

Our application is a personalized financial planning and projection system through coding in Python.It is designed to provide a variety of users a practical, user-oriented avenue to financial wellness. More specifically, this application would center on a budgeting system, through saving user data, such as income and expenses, while using this input to calculate projections of the best ways in which to save money for the future. Included in this application would be welcoming and encouraging reminder messages periodically sent to users. These messages would be for the purpose of informing them of significant dates approaching, tips on methods of improving spending habits, rewards for recent saving, prompts concerning goals set by the user, and finally notifications of projections based on the budgeting model at the center of the application. 


## Getting Started

### We will need to find related repository code centering on:

[X] Login/Logout Info  
[X] Saving User Data Input  
[X] Budgeting  
[X] Reminders  
[ ] Projections  
[X] Math/Calculations  
[ ] User Interface/Graphic Design 

Each of these aspects will lend themselves to the final product of the processes of our application.
